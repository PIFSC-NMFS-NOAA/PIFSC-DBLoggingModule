_ Develop query logic for searching clob values in the ENTRY_CONTENT field so this can be used as a standard query and provided to developers/users

_ provide the application code for constructing the CLOB variable value from a large variable in an application (e.g. PHP output_message.php class appending CLOB values using a buffer or bind variables)

X caution users against too much logging, this can cause the database to fill up quickly with logging messages
	X errors should be logged and during development they can use debugging messages to help troubleshoot existing functionality and implement new functionality

X remove the return code parameter from the procedure (it's not necessary)
	the procedure call is now overloaded based on the parameters that are supplied to allow legacy code to continue to run

_ implement debug mode for DB logging module? (won't log "DEBUG" entries otherwise), this could be a flag in the DB instance (CC_CONFIG_OPTIONS)
